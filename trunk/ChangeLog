	* grocerific/model.py (ShoppingItem): It appears that SQLObject no
	longer supports orderBy as an argument to selectBy()?  Set the
	_defaultOrder value for classes that used to have explicit orderBy
	arguments in queries.

	* dev.cfg (staticFilter.dir): Make staticFilter.dir point to a
	fully qualified directory name.

	* grocerific/templates/index.kid: Drop the different views for
	logged in vs. not logged in.

	* grocerific/user.py (UserManager.login): On login, redirect to
	'/list' to go to the "Next List" for the user.
